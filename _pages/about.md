Hi all, I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate major in Embedded Systems in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
I work closely with [Prof. Pei Zhang](https://peizhang.engin.umich.edu/) and collabrotes solidly with [Structures as Sensors Lab](https://noh-lab.stanford.edu/research) at the Stanford University. 
My research focuses on modeling <strong><u>closed-loop vibration sensing systems</u></strong> that can adaptively perceive the environment through passive observation, and then through active excitation informed by what the system has already learned. I work at the intersection of physics-based modeling and data-driven inference, designing sensing frameworks where excitation, measurement, and analysis continuously refine one another. A central part of my approach is iterative validation between lab prototyping and real-world deployment. This cycle enables robust, scalable systems that transform everyday structures into reliable sensing platforms.
To validate my research in various real-world scenarios, I collaborate with diverse partners such as:

- [Michigan Stadium](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3736425.3770100)
- [AiFi (Autonomous Retail)](https://aifi.com/about-us/)
- [USDA (Animal Care)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3604806)
- [NSF CPI Center (Pandemics Prevention)](https://www.pandemicinsights.org/)

Before my Ph.D., I spent my master career working with Prof. Alanson Sample in the [Interaction Sensing & Computing Lab](https://theisclab.com/team.html) and developed 
UltraMic, a privacy-preserving indoor activity recognition and localization system using ultrasound microphone array.
