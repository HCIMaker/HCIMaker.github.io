abstract = {Heart rate is one of the most critical metrics for human health. Most common methods for measuring human heart rate involve body contact, whether from wearable devices or manual measurement. However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients. Past work for non-contact or remote heart rate measurement (e.g., camera or radio) is often limited by line-of-sight requirements that are not always possible in the real-world environment.This paper presents FloHR, an indirect heart rate monitoring system for human beings using heartbeat-induced floor vibrations. The key insight is that the human body generates a small wave of pressure and sound with each heartbeat. These are propagated as vibration through the structures the person is in contact with (e.g., a chair) and through the floor. FloHR then detects and interprets these small floor vibrations. We developed a highly sensitive vibration sensing system and heartbeat pattern modelling to identify these tiny vibrations among other body motions and ambient noise.We evaluated FloHR in a real home environment, demonstrating an average heart rate error similar to medical device standards on the floor near the subjects' chair, and on the order of 10 beats per minute (bpm) on the floor 2 meters away from the subject.},

abstract = {Computer vision has been used more ubiquitously in recent years to understand and measure the environment around us, particularly in our neighborhoods. However, many city-wide sensing applications using vision require large labeling efforts, making various applications difficult on a wide scale. We propose a framework for labeling and self-training of in-car video to detect trash on the roads. Our approach requires minimal manual labeling to identify items not meant to be in the street, sidewalk, or public places, from a front-viewing car camera. Our system provides each frame of a video with a score indicating the amount of trash. To prevent overfitting, due to minimal available data, we remove data with high certainty of trash from the training dataset. The results show that our prediction with manually labeled ground truth yield an R2 of 0.66.},

abstract = {Heart rate is a critical metric for human cardiovascular health. Most common methods for measuring human heart rate involve wearable devices (e.g., electrocardiography, smart watches). However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients, especially the elderly or young children. This paper presents FreePulse, a heart rate monitoring system for seated subjects using ambient vibrations. FreePulse builds on our past work using vibrations in the building structures around us to measure human activities and health. As people’s hearts beat, they push on the surfaces the body is touching, creating vibrations in those structures. We combine structure response characterization with human pulse modelling to identify these pulse-induced vibrations from ambient vibration. In testing, FreePulse has shown up to 96\% pulse rate accuracy on average, competitive with consumer-grade wearable devices.},

abstract = {Object classification is a vital technology that is widely used to track and identify misplaced and out-of-stock items in shopping centers. While there have been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision, RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6\% accuracy in distinguishing five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings beyond shopping centers.},

abstract = {Adjusting the balance between the player’s game skill and the difficulty level is one of the most important factors to improve the player’s engagement. However, it is still quite rare to find works that aim to straightly control the subjective difficulty perceived by the player. Our research question is whether or not it is possible to control the perceived difficulty just by adding enemy objects that do not raise the actual difficulty level. To investigate this issue, we designed a simple shooting game with two ‘fake enemy bullets’: Unreachable Bullets and Non-collisionable Bullets, which do not damage the player character. The experiment suggests that the non-collisionable bullet can efficiently increase the perceived difficulty level but the unreachable bullet does not. Such a study in novel techniques that can control the perceived difficulty without changing the actual difficulty could contribute to both research and practices in game design.},

abstract = {Vortex beams have witnessed tremendous development in the pastdecade by exhibiting profound implications for both fundamental physicsand a multitude of novel engineering applications. In this work, broadbandhigh-efficiency multiple vortex beams with independent topological modesand inclination angles are generated leveraging an interleavedgeometric-phase multifunctional metasurface operating in a very broadbandfrequency range. A set of meta-atoms are elaborately engineered to offerbroadband high-efficiency complete phase control covering the entire2\&\#x03C0; range. Multiple geometric-phase sub-arrays implemented by thedesigned meta-atoms are synthesized into one metasurface via ashared-aperture interleaved manner, in which each sub-array can beindividually manipulated and serves as an independent channel forlaunching a vortex beam. According to the established design methodology,two vortex beams with topological modes of \&\#x2212;1 and \&\#x002B;2 anddistinct inclination angles are generated by one metasurface. Experimentalresults are provided to corroborate the proposed mechanism for multiplevortex beams generation, which exhibit broadband and high-efficiencyfeatures. The presented multifunctional metasurface paves the way for thegeneration of broadband high-efficiency multiple vortex beams in themicrowave, millimeter-wave and terahertz regions. This work is ofsignificance for high-capacity wireless communication applications,high-efficiency manipulation of electromagnetic waves, and novel design ofradar and imaging systems.},

abstract = {On the one hand, accelerating convolution neural networks (CNNs) on FPGAs requires ever increasing high energy efficiency in the edge computing paradigm. On the other hand, unlike normal digital algorithms, CNNs maintain their high robustness even with limited timing errors. By taking advantage of this unique feature, we propose to use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to further optimize the energy efficiency for CNNs. First, we have developed a DVFS framework on FPGAs. Second, we apply the DVFS to SkyNet, a state-of-the-art neural network targeting on object detection. Third, we analyze the impact of DVFS on CNNs in terms of performance, power, energy efficiency and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art, experimental results show that we have achieved 38% improvement in energy efficiency without any loss in accuracy. Results also show that we can achieve 47% improvement in energy efficiency if we allow 0.11% relaxation in accuracy.}
