Our work leverages high-frequency sound beyond human hearing (8kHz-48kHz) for privacy-preserving activity recognition and localization using a 49-channel microphone array and deep learning. This system avoids privacy concerns of traditional microphones while enabling accurate identification of activities like cooking or boiling water. By integrating transfer learning, few-shot learning, and user-specific association, we aim to enhance activity recognition, address multi-user scenarios, and expand the scope of detectable activities, paving the way for innovative, privacy-centric applications in health, wellness, and home automation.

The work is still under development, hope to see it soon, but let's check out the quick demo here :sunglasses:
